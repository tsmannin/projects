# Projects

My name is Tristan Manning.

I am a graduate of the University of Santa Cruz, with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and a Minor in Statistics.
I attended Orange Coast College for 4 years before my transfer, where I completed a large portion of my undergrad.

These are some of the projects I have worked on and often led.
